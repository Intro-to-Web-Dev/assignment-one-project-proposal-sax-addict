        <h1>Mission statement</h1>
        <p>This site will be an educational site about the history, anatomy and variations of saxophones</p>
        <h2>Goals:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>saxophone structure and design</li>
            <li>saxophone history</li>
            <li>saxophone variations</li>
            <li>Basic Music theory</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Site models</h2>
        <p>I would like to model my site after <a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia.</a> Though my page will have MUCH less content I think it is a very clean model for a site based on reading. I do want to add color Though</p>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>Ideally there will be a page for:</p>
            <p>History (main page): describes the history of the saxophone and how it's changed since it was invented</p>
            <p>Design: how and why a saxophone works </p>
            <p>Eb family: half of the saxophone types, shows similarities and differences</p>
            <p>Bb family: other half of the saxophone types</p>
            <p>basic music theory:Just enough to understand the difference between the 2 families</p>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Anyone who has in interest in learning about the saxophone</p>
